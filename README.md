# PyPowerSim
PyPowerSim is a simple python toolkit for evaluation of standard power converter topologies.
The current version includes simulation architectures for a half-bridge (B2), a 
full-bridge (B4), and a three-phase full-bridge converter (B6) [1, 2]. The toolkit 
allows simple and fast calculation of power converter circuits including waveform, 
stead-state, and transient analysis using datasheet values of switching devices and 
DC-link capacitors. The aim is to illustrate the influence of PWM control methods 
to students and the interested reader without the use of commercial tools like SIMULINK, 
PLECs or LTSpice. It is clear, that this toolkit cannot be anywhere near the capabilities 
of commercial software but will hopefully provide a better understanding due to the freely 
available source code. The toolkit is obviously not complete; thus, suggestions are 
always welcome.

    
# Publication
The PyPowerSim toolkit is part of the following survey paper and tries to replicate 
the presented architectures and approaches. Please cite the following paper when 
using the PyPowerSim toolkit. When using the B6 architecture and the waveform analysis 
options please also refer to the following article:

Schirmer, Pascal A., Daniel Glose, and Ulrich Ammann. "Zero-voltage and frequency pattern 
selection for DC-link loss minimization in PWM-VSI drives." Electrical Engineering (2022): 1-10.


# Dependencies
The requirements of the PyPowerSim toolkit are summarized in the requirements.txt data file.
In detail, the PyPowerSim Toolkit was implemented using the following dependencies:
- Python 3.8
- Numpy 
- Pandas
- Scipy

The complete list of requirements and packages can be found in "requirements.txt".


# Limitations
Since the toolkit is still under development there are several things that need to be 
improved, are not yet implemented or lack verification with numerical models or measurements.
In the following a list of know issues and limitations is provided:
- The transfer functions for the input and output filter are not yet verified. Also, there is no protection against instability of the transfer functions.
- Soft switching architectures are not included yet.
- The interpolation methods for calculating the tabulated parameter options are only linear.
- Plotting error for average DC voltage in B6 configuration

# Architecture
The architecture implemented in the PyPowerSim toolkit is exemplary illustrated for a B2 
converter cell in Figure 1. The source code implementation of the PyPowerSim toolkit aims
to follow the data follow of the implementation in Figure 1 for the interested reader to
follow the data and signal flow path through the implementation. The complete description of the
toolkit can be found in \docu.

![img_4.png](docu%2Fimages%2Fimg_4.png)
Figure 1: Proposed converter architecture as implemented in the PyPowerSim toolkit.

As illustrated in Figure 1 the architecture consists of five blocks namely the source, the input
filter, the converter cell, the output filter and the load. Each of these blocks can be freely
configured with the parameter setup described. In the following a short description
without consideration of the filter elements is provided. For the complete description please 
refer to the theory guide and the following theoretical works. The converter is power by a voltage source having a constant dc voltage of $V_{dc}$. The converter is controlled by a time
domain switching function $s_a(t)$ translating the constant dc link voltage in a set of high-frequent voltage pulses as
described in (1):

$v_{a0}(t) = s_{a}(t) \cdot \frac{V_{dc}}{2}$     (1)

The switching function can hereby be described as a set of on- and off-states of the high-side switch $S_{a}^{+}$ and the 
low-side switch $S_{a}^{-}$ and can be expressed in the time-domain by the Fourier series in (2):

$s_{a}(t) = \sum_{v=1} (a_v cos(v \omega_{el} t) + b_v cos(v \omega_{el} t)) = \sum_{v=1} c_v e^{-j v \omega_{el} t}$ (2)

where $a_v$, $b_v$, $c_v$ are the Fourier series coefficients, $v$ is the harmonic number and $\omega_{el}$ is the 
electrical circular frequency of the output current. The relation between the current and voltage on the load side can 
then be expressed by the following differential equation in (3):

$v_{L}(t) = R_{L} i_{L}(t) + L_{L} \frac{di_{L}}{dt} + e(t)$ (3)

where $R_{L}$, $L_{L}$ are the resistance and the inductance of the load, $e(t)$ is the induced voltage, and $v_{L}(t)$, $i_{L}(t)$ 
are the load voltage and current respectively.


# Usage
Using PyPowerSim is straight forward and requires only two inputs, namely the model parameters for the switching devices
and the dc-link capacitor and the configuration file including experimental, data, topology, as well as parameter
information. Detailed information about these two inputs are provided below:

## Configuration 
The configuration file is an .xlsx file that is stored under \config and includes all parameter which are relevant for
the simulation. In detail, these parameters are grouped in four different categories, namely experimental, data, topology,
as well as parameters. Explanation as well as valid inputs for each parameter can be found in the configuration file, 
description of the configuration file can be found below:

1) Name:          Descriptive name of the variable (arbitrary identifier)
2) Category:      Category of the variable (might be empty) 
3) Description:   Detailed description of the variable including valid options
4) Variable:      Variable name used inside the source code
5) Value:         Value of the respective variable
6) Unit:          Unit of the respective variable

From the above column only the 'Value' column should be adapted by the user, the other columns must not be changed as
they are used for reading the value.

## Parameters
The parameter files include one .xlsx file for the switching devices and one for the dc-lin capacitor respectively. In
detail, these files include electrical and thermal parameters of the respective component. Explanation as well as valid
inputs for each parameter can be found in the configuration file, description of the configuration file can be found 
below: 

1) Parameter:     Arbitrary identifier for the respective parameter
2) Description:   Description of the parameter
3) Model:         Definition for which modeling approach the parameter is used (constant, linear, or tabular)
4) Symbol:        Symbol used inside the source code
5) Typical:       Typical value of the variable
6) Values:        Values of the variable
7) Unit:          Unit of the variable

From the above column only the 'Value' column should be adapted by the user, the other columns must not be changed as
they are used for reading the value.

## Start Script
To execute a new simulation three things are needed. First, a valid configuration file as discussed above. Second, valid
parameter files for the switching devices and the capacitor. Third a start script as provided in start.py used for
defining the configuration and the parameter .xlsx files as well as the simulation mode. The following aspects can be 
defined in the start script:

### General
1) Name:    Name of the simulation file (used for saving outputs)
2) Author:  Author of the simulation
3) Debug:   Debug mode for checking internal results
4) Output:  Simulation output, i.e. output variable that is controlled (Current, Voltage, Power, etc.)
5) Type:    Simulation type, i.e. operating mode of the toolkit (Sweep, Steady-State, Transient, etc.)

### Input Files
1) Conf:    Configuration .xlsx file stored under \config used as input for general parameters and settings
2) Swi:     Parameter .xlsx file of the switching devices stored under \para\Swi
3) Cap      Parameter .xlsx file of the dc-link capacitor stored under \para\Cap

### Plotting and Saving
1) Plot:    Plotting options for displaying results
2) PlotGen: Generic plots for thermal and electrical models as well as transfer functions
3) Save:    Option for saving results to \results

# Results
In the following chapter a set of reference results is provided using the B6 converter 
architecture and the default setup file. For the default operation an IFX switch is chosen (
IKQ75N120CS6) For a first test run use start.py to calculate the results presented below.

## Model Inputs

## Steady-State Operation
In this Section the results for the steady-state analysis are presented, the results are calculated in closed-loop 
condition, such that the losses are extracted for the stabilized temperature of the junction. The time-domain results
for the currents, the voltages, as well as the conduction and switching losses for the six switches are illustrated 
in Figure 5.

## Transient Operation
In this Section the results for the steady-state analysis are presented, the results are calculated in closed-loop 
condition such that the parameters are updated after every fundamental period, i.e. $T_s$=20 ms. The results are averaged
once over the switching sequence, thus displaying junction temperature swing in Figure 7, and once are average over the
fundamental cycle thus illustrating the self-heating due to the internal losses in Figure 8. It should also be noted, 
that in Figure 8 the parameter updates and the positive coupling of the channel resistances and voltages with the 
junction temperature are visible.
